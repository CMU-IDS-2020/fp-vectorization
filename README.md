## Abstract

With a Narrative track for this final project, our team will analyze the donation statistics from [DonorsChoose.org](http://DonorsChoose.org), a funding platform for public school teachers to find resources in need, to make visualizations. Our essential question is: what is the current state of funding for public schools. We learn that public schools need more funding to provide quality education that will play an important role in studentsâ€™ learning outcomes. We would like to help users and potential donors understand the challenges that public schools face and what their needs are.

First, we will present a number of visualizations to provide useful information about the donation statistics over the past years, and help future donors to explore the options to make contributions for public education on their end. The visualizations will generally introduce two aspects of the data: Donation Cost Analysis for all donations, and Successful Rate Analysis for the project proposals hosted on the platform.

Second, based on our observation, a large number of projects are not fully-funded at the end. Therefore, we want to build a model to predict whether a project can be fully funded or not, to allow teachers to better understand what are some characteristics for projects to get fully-funded, and how they should refine their project proposals. In addition, we provide two interactive components to help users better understand our proposed model, in which they can explore the model's responses
